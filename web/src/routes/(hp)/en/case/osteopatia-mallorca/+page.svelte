        Kaddio Case study @ Mallorca, Spain

    <span slot="title">Meet Silvia</span>
    <span slot="subtitle">
      Silvia Triay is about to go kitesurfing with her family. She carefully watches the movement of the wind and waves at the Sa Rápita beach in Mallorca. 
    </span>


    <span slot="intro">
      "You must be sharp and responsive at all times", Silvia says.
      Just as carefully as she watches the waves of the ocean, Silvia watches the movements and responses of her clients during osteopathic treatments.
      "You know that the circumstances may change at any moment and you have to adapt to whatever will happen next."
    </span>



    <LegalParagraph>
      Silvia and her husband run the center Osteopatía Mallorca in Palma. In 2022, they started the transition from pen and paper to digital medical records, using Kaddio.
