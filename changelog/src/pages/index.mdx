Kaddio is sunsetting the On-premise version of Kaddio during 2024, no new customers will be joining this product. This means we will put much more energy and focus on Kaddio Cloud!

All existing customers are informed and we will be providing a LTS version of Kaddio for the remainder of the time.

### <SparkleIcon /> What do I need to do?
- There is nothing you need to do.

## Project configuration files {{ date: '2023-03-17T00:00Z' }}

I've added support for creating per-project `.commitrc` files that override your global settings for that particular project. Went with YAML for these because personally I'm sick of quoting keys in JSON all the time, or accidentally leaving in a trailing comma.

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements

- Added per-project `.commitrc` configuration files
- Improved performance when working with projects with large binary files
- Fixed a bug that could cause Commit to crash when autocommitting after deleting a recently active branch

## Dark mode support {{ date: '2023-03-06T00:00Z' }}

I released this thing last week hoping a couple of people would say "awesome job" and make me feel good about what I'd built but instead I just got a ton of people shaming me on Twitter for being such a horrible person for only shipping a light UI.

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements

- Added dark mode support
- Improved input field responsiveness when writing a commit message in a project with a large number of changed files
- Made keyboard shortcut for opening the Commit window customizable
- Deleted my Twitter account

## v23-16 {{  date: '2023-04-23T00:00Z' }}

Commit is a command palette-style Git client you can pull up from anywhere with a keyboard shortcut that makes it really easy to commit your work. It uses the "last modified" timestamp of the files in all of your projects to automatically know which project you're in the middle of working on, so any time you pull up the UI it's already got the right project selected â€” you just have to type your commit message, hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> and your changes are captured.

### <SparkleIcon /> New features
- Auto tick-off updates
- Translations ES

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements
- Better card payment tests
